This is where I keep the things I did.

Most recently, I gave a presentation on [skill assessments in gamified curricula][a], the talk was called Branch vs. Root and it was about best practices for skill badges or merit badges in a classroom setting. Aside from the blog [Partly Wicked][b], where I write about escape rooms, the last time I wrote (or said) anything in public was in 2015, in World Literature Today, [Haitian is My Language][c], an interview with the author Franetienn√©, followed by an article about Haitian literature. I also interviewed folklorist and [fairy tale expert Jack Zipes][d] that year, again for World Literature Today, and in the LA Review of Books, I interviewed [author Michael Cunningham][e] in connection with his novel The Snow Queen. I also wrote an article for n+1 (and for the Faber and Faber anthology City x City) called [This is Not a Brothel][f], about an escort service in Washington, DC. {: target="_blank"}.
