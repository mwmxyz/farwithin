title: Where Am I?
---

This is where I keep older publications. Feel free to look at one or two of them, if you came all the way down here from the dark blue link.
All the work is really mine, but I'm not sure if the pictures are actually pictures of me, or if they're pictures of the way I remember myself (and Vermont, where I grew up. In my mind it was always Autumn.)
